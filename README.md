# telegram_SUTDMountaineeringBanterBot
Just a quick regex filter bot to shout something stupid when it reads a message. AKA Bantering.

## Setup
Set a .env file with the following details:
```
mode = 'dev'
TOKEN = XXXXX (not a string)
```
Set Bot in BotFather group privacy to off / give admin rights to the bot
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future updates will be a flexible bot. Right now it only hard codes fixed replies and also include user being able to add more response via Telegram itself.

Say real tho,
We got to stop saying "Say Real"
